Ideas for avuserow to implement:

Non-modules:
- an IRC bot using Net::IRC::Bot

Perl 5 "direct" ports:
- Set::CartestianProduct::Lazy
- Math::SigFigs?
- Log:Log4perl?

Modules to create:
- Logging, a la Log::Log4perl, Log::Tiny or something in between
- Caching, a la Cache::Cache or something simpler
- Cookie library
--- would hold cookies from LWP::Simple or similar
--- would be able to load cookies from various on-disk formats
- Sereal serializer/deserializer
--- requires bindings to Snappy: http://code.google.com/p/snappy/
--- requires a varint parser, maybe worth extracting
- Storable serializer/deserializer
- Bindings to libssh2
--- scary, requires making bindings to sockets or similar
- Bindings to libpurple
--- probably very scary

Modules to improve that I made:
- Audio::Taglib::Simple
--- investigate potential memory leaks

Modules to improve that others made:
- Protocol Buffers (https://github.com/samuraisam/p6-pb)
- SSL - add ciphers (AES, etc)
- Digest? Sum? Another of the pure-Perl hashing modules?
- Template6? Template::Mojo?
